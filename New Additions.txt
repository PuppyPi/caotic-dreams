:D!

+ Note: the exact letters/characters used are totally open to discussion, I have no attachment to any particular wording XD'




===Backwards compatible!===
• INST? / SLOW?  directives in comments
	Like INST/SLOW but only if INST blocks are fast—namely, if INST blocks are compiled, and ignored if compilation isn't done :3



===Backwards incompatible===
• CALT - CALl Targ
	CALL on TARG instead of OWNR! :D
• CALA v - CALl given Agent
	CALL on v instead of 

• You can RETN from anywhere you like inside a SUBR! even inside a loop or doif-else or etc.!  :D

• VA and OV (and MV) above 99!  :DD

• CAOS isn't limited to four letters!  (but we often use that bc it's cute and cultural :33 )

• Sound effects aren't limited to four letters!  (sdlfjsdflkj whyyyyy were they? XD )

• Message queues so MESG/CALT/etc.'ing agents won't abort/interrupt/overwrite the currently-running event script! :'D
	The MESG WRIT / MESG WRT+ commands still do it the old way by default, for backwards-compatibility, but there are new commands for it :3
	+ And the message queues are saved to / loaded from disk! :D

• Scheduled tasks (including MESG WRT+ !) that are saved to / loaded from disk! :D
	+ They work by treating time exclusively as an integer number of ticks :3

• SUBRs that return return values and accept parameters like real functions?! :D

• Expressions for arithmetic! :D
	• Like ADDV/SUBV but is a function that returns a value instead of being a command!
	• Ones for boolean things like <> and >=!  This both *fully* alleviates the need for parentheses (since only infix grammars need parentheses and it's MUCH easier to parse a language that doesn't need them!  And CAOS is *almost* a Polish (aka Prefix) Notation language!  And with these now it is fully :>   Also you can use them (booleans!) in normal code not just special "(condition)" commands like DOIF and UNTL! :D )

• Byte Strings a proper values not just for ANIM but can be stored in variables and stuff like text strings! :D
	• This also opens up a whole world of low-level binary file format parsing in CAOS 8>  XD

• Other datatypes potentially!  —Aiko wants arrays, for one! XD  :D

• STPA is like STPT just with explicit agent not TARG (might as well add this now while we're doing it XD')
• STOPT is like STOP just with TARG not OWNR
• STOPA is like STOPT just with explicit agent not TARG
	+ STOPx stops the currently-called script, while STPx stops the whole call stack!
	+ We add so many (all the combinations!) because they have to be special-cased by the compiler, so it's not easy to just add new ones ^^'
• STPO is just STOPA OWNR

• LONGV is just a command that does nothing when run, but makes code intentionally backwards-incompatible with platforms providing 32-bit integers/floats, to be used if your code *requires* 64-bit integers/floats like CaoticDreams provides.
	+ Signed 64-bit integers, to be clear (if we support others, we'd use ULONGV someday, but that's quite inconvenient and complex in Java so I won't worry about it for now since signed 64-bit ints is way more than anyone asked for as it is XD'' )

• NOT#, AND#, OR#, LT#, GE#, etc. (or whatever we call them) work for conditions and use the Polish/Prefix Notation like other functions, so that way you don't need parentheses :3
	Eg,
		a AND NOT (b OR c)  →  AND# a  NOT  OR# b c
		a AND (NOT b) OR c  →  AND# a  OR#  NOT b  c
		a AND (b = c)  →  AND# a  EQ# b c
		(a AND b) = c  →  EQ#  AND# a b  c
	
	+ This wasn't previously an issue because NOT didn't exist and booleans ("condition" type in the docs) wasn't a First-Class Type you could store in variables and use "=" and "<>" on!

• Short-circuiting boolean AND and OR!  :D
	Maybe..idk, "AND!" and "OR!" ?  XD
	(and then what?  "AND!#" and "OR!#" ?  XD )







---Backwards incompatible things we *need* for internal compiler passes and parsing and such!---
• *Not* GOTO like the original engine needs!  But these are similar to that! :D


• STPN is like STPA and STOPN is like STOPA but they can't work on OWNR (they'll throw a caos exception)
	So here's the transformation :3
		STPT → STPA TARG
		STOPT → STOPA TARG
		STPA v   →  DOIF v = OWNR  STPO  ELSE  STPN v   ENDI
		STOPA v  →  DOIF v = OWNR  STOP  ELSE  STOPN v  ENDI
		
		And STPN and STOPN are just normal commands,
		While STOP and STPO compile to very special code (including "return" in Java!!)
		(All of this is important only for compiled INST code)


• CALN is like STPN
	CALT .. → CALA TARG
	CALA v ..  →  DOIF v = OWNR  CALL ..  ELSE  CALN v ..  ENDI
		So CALN can be a normal command and not cause a compilation break :3


• KILN/KILO is like STPN
	KILL a  →  DOIF a = OWNR  KILO  ELSE  KILN a  ENDI


• ADD#, MUL#, ABS#, etc.
	Since byref things ("(variable)" in the docs) are only supported by special-casing all caos commands that use them and converting them into one of the SETx's and 
	ADDV var adden → SETV var ADD# var adden
	
	And then SETV is super special, while ADD# is just a normal function :3


• RETU
	Return a value from a function! :D
	(STOP can be used for return-value-less functions X3 )
	
	We need this even without Proper Functions for Soft CAOS, where CAOS is extended with new commands in the softcaos/ directory or whatever X3 :D


• NAMEA vars like NAME/MAME but with explicit agent
	This way the compiler doesn't need to worry about optimizing multiple versions, and we might want it someday anyway so might as well unify the three into one X3
	NAME k → NAMEA TARG k
	MAME k → NAMEA OWNR k


• SETX and REQV/REQI/REQF/REQS/REQA/etc.
	SETV/SETA/SETS/etc. but doesn't make you know the type ahead of time (finally! XD )
	
	SETV var val  →  REQV val  SETX var val
	SETS var val  →  REQS val  SETX var val
	
	And we might as well add SETI/REQI for ints, SETF/REQF for floats, and REQC for conditions (booleans) (or should we call it REQB?)  :>
	
	+ Adding REQ's helps with the type-inference optimization of the compiler (which isn't implemented yet XD'' )





--- Big future XD ---
• Real proper functions!! :DD
	+ Including Always Compiled functions, so you can invoke global functions (that might be unloaded/loaded in the scriptorium!) without causing a compilation break!! :DD
	+ And local functions which the compiler can super-optimize and be super-fast since they can't change :3
		+ That'd be a quirk, like if you define a function as Global in the same .cos file that uses it, then it gets changed, that cos file's uses of it would change like any other code
			But if it was a local function, well..you *can't* unload/change it! XD   So it can be part of the scripts in the same file as it.  For example it can be Inlined (as we say :3 ) into the functions that invoke it (eg, if the local function was just a few lines of code, it might copy that directly into the caller, replacing the code "invoke this function" with the actual function's code! XD   that's a common thing for compilers to do :3 )

• Real proper data types!! :DD
	+ Because using entire Agents and Hash Maps for everything (NAME/MAME variables) is *not high performance* XD
